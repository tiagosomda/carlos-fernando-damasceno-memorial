## of Carlos Fernando Damasceno
June 23, 1957 – January 23, 2025

Carlos Fernando Damasceno, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend, passed away peacefully on January 23, 2025. He lived a life defined by generosity, service, and an unwavering commitment to making the world a better place.

For Carlos, love was expressed through acts of service. He was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether to his family, friends, or his community. A brilliant mind, he played a pivotal role in the development of FlexFuel technology, a breakthrough that has helped countless people in Brazil afford transportation while reducing carbon emissions worldwide. Yet, when asked if he wished he had been compensated more for his work, his response was simple:
"It doesn’t matter. What matters is the positive impact it has on people’s lives and the world."

Carlos and his beloved wife, Evelin, shared a love for traveling. After retiring, they fulfilled their dream of exploring the United States in their RV, visiting countless parks, cities, and beaches together. He also had a passion for improving the communities he was a part of, dedicating his time to organizations such as:

- Alphaville Campinas (Brazil): He volunteered to improve the neighborhood he called home.
- Lochmere Neighborhood (NC): As an HOA member, he worked to better the community.
- Brazilian Association of the Triangle (ABT): An organization serving thousands of Brazilian families in North Carolina and beyond.
- His Family: He was always there, ready to help whenever needed.
- The World: His work on FlexFuel was driven by a desire to create a more sustainable and affordable future.

Carlos is survived by his loving wife, Evelin; his children, Cristiane, Susane, Tiago, and Adriane; his sons-in-law, Miguel and Derrick; his daughter-in-law, Priscila; and his cherished grandchildren, Thales, and soon-to-be-born Emilio and Valentina. His legacy lives on in the values he instilled, the kindness he shared, and the many lives he touched.

A memorial service will be held on February 23rd at 1 PM at the Sancar Turkish Cultural and Community Center.

In honor of his memory, donations can be made to The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation. The family also welcomes stories, photos, and videos celebrating Carlos’s life, which can be sent to memorial@fernandodamasceno.com.

Carlos will be deeply missed but forever cherished.
