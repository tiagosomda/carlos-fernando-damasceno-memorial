## of Carlos Fernando Damasceno
June 23, 1957 ~ January 23, 2025

Carlos Fernando Damasceno, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and friend, passed away peacefully on January 23, 2025. He lived a life defined by generosity, service, and an unwavering commitment to making the world a better place.

For Carlos, love was expressed through acts of service. He was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether to his family, friends, or his community. A brilliant mind, he played a pivotal role in the development of FlexFuel technology, a breakthrough that has helped countless people in Brazil afford transportation while reducing carbon emissions worldwide. Yet, when asked if he wished he had been compensated more for his work, his response was simple:
"It doesn’t matter. What matters is the positive impact it has on people’s lives and the world."

Carlos and his beloved wife, Evelin, shared a love for traveling. After retiring, they fulfilled their dream of exploring the United States in their RV, visiting countless parks, cities, and beaches together. He also had a passion for improving the communities he was part of.

His legacy lives on in the values he instilled, the kindness he shared, and the many lives he touched.
Carlos will be deeply missed but forever cherished.
